## What is it?

An unconference is a conversation-based event. There won't be 1 person at the front delivering a lecture, it will be a group of peers discussing and debating things that we love/hate about software.

### Which things?
Well, that's up to you. Propose a topic that you care about, and be prepared to facilitate the conversation.
Maybe it's something around your favourite language? Something about process & delivery?
Maybe it's something you heard at the conference the previous day and you want to dig a bit deeper?

### Will there be projectors?
Yes, we will have projectors, and maybe a few slides would help your session. But - to repeat myself a little - It isn't a lecture, it's a conversation.


## When is it?

Saturday 2nd April
09:30 - 18:00

Sunday 3rd April
09:00 - 16:00

## Will the Codemania speakers be there?

Yes! All 12 speakers have been invited to participate in Conversations, and we are hopeful that all/most will be there. This is a *unique* opportunity for you to chat with, and learn from, some of the very brightest minds around.


## What are the rules?

As a Codemania event, the Code of Conduct applies: We expect you to Be Nice at all times! (http://codemania.io/be-nice.html)

It's pretty simple really - everyone has something to contribute to the conversation, and we must create an environment where everyone is respected and can be heard.

People who don't respect the CoC may be asked to leave.

## Where is it?

Codemania Conversations is happening at the idyllic [Waitakere Estate](http://www.waitakereestate.co.nz/). Set against a backdrop of unique rainforest and just 40 minutes from Auckland's CBD - all the fun of an un-conference, with a bit of luxury sprinkled on top!

## How can I get there?

Unconferences are fun and collaberative! Make a new friend and [organise a lift-share](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bCF0P5pL8_U9nzpjGa6niFR9ebg8Omo8bsNW94D6XZA/edit?usp=sharing)

If you have a car and are planning on driving, please add your name to the sheet; indicate where you're coming from, how many empty seats you have and when you're travelling (e.g. both mornings and evenings, or maybe just Saturday morning and Sunday evening)

If you need a lift, add your name to a travelling car.

If people get completely stuck for lifts, let us know: [hello@codemania.co.nz](mailto:hello@codemania.co.nz) - and we'll do our best to work something out!

## Can't I stay at the hotel?

If you got a 'weekender' ticket then yes, you're booked in. Otherwise, you'll need to travel in both days.
